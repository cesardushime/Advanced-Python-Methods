# A decorator is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it.
# Allows you to wrap another function in order to extend the behavior of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it.
# Decorators can be used to check for permissions, modify or track the arguments passed to a function, log the calls to a function, etc.

    def wrapper(): # wrapper function that adds sprinkles to the icecream

def add_cherry(func):

@add_cherry # decorator that adds cherry to the icecream
# The order of the decorators matters. The decorator that is defined first is the one that is executed last.
